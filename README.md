# Quantum-half-adder-and-full-adder
Simulating quantum half-adder and full-adder using qiskit library and IBM quantum lab.
Quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations beyond the reach of classical computers. This project delves into the realm of quantum computing by designing and implementing quantum circuits for a full adder and half adder using the Qiskit library in Jupyter Lab. The circuit leverage fundamental quantum gates, including CNOT and Toffoli gates, to execute classical addition operations in a quantum framework. The simulation of these circuits on the IBM Quantum Learning Lab allows for a detailed examination of their behavior and efficiency. Through exploring, the project contributes to the understanding of quantum algorithms and their potential impact on computer architecture.
